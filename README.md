## Overview

In this assignment, I have created an Amazon-like storefront with the MySQL learned this week in my coding bootcamp. This CLI app displays the store's current inventory, can take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory. 

It is also programmed to track product sales across the store's departments and then provide a summary of the highest-grossing departments in the store.
